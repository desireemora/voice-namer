# voice-namer
<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>Reads in a batch of images, displays each one on the screen one at a time, then allows you to name it through voice command.
I find myself wanting to name an enormous amount of image files (sometimes even music files), but I don't want to have to open the properties of all of them one by one to name them. So I was thinking voice comands would let you bybass the repetition.</p>

<h1>Notice</h1>
<p><b>You must have pillow which is a fork of PIL. The fork exists because the Python Imaging Library (PIL) is no longer being updated. The photo files must be in the same folder as the code. Help with downloading speach recognition libraries can be found <a href="https://github.com/desireemora/voice-namer/blob/master/README_SpeachRecognition.md">here</a>.</b></p>

<h4>TIPS:</h4>

<p><b>Pillow Installation</b></p>
<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35929306/how-to-install-pil-to-python-3-5-on-a-mac/35929343</p>
<p>https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/</p>
<p>https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html</p>

<b>Python IDE</b>
<p>I recomend using pythons IDE for compiling your code as it will have access to the pillows libraries imediately. Pillow doesnt work with my personla compiler and I assume it's because the ibraries arent downloaded somewhere that the compiler can access.</p>

<b>Atom</b>
<p>Is a beautiful text editor that is amazingly customizable. Before you write your code in the text editor, just name the file with a ".py" extension and save it.</p>
