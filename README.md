# voice-namer
Reads a batch of image meta data, shows you on the screen, allows you to name it through voice command.
I find myself wanting to name an enormous amount of image files (sometimes even music files), but I don't want to have to open the properties of all of them one by one to name them. So I was thinking voice comand let you bybass the repetition.
