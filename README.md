# voice-namer
Reads a batch of image meta data, shows you on the screen, allows you to name it through voice command.
I find myself wanting to name an enormous amount of image files (sometimes even music files), but I don't want to have to open the properties of all of them one by one to name them. So I was thinking voice comand would let you bybass the repetition. 

<b/>You must have pillow which is a fork of PIL. The fork exists because the Python Imaging Library (PIL) is no longer being updated. <b>

<b/>TIPS:<b>

<b/>Pillow Installation<b> <br/><br>

<b/>Python IDE<b/><br/><br>
I recomend using pythons IDE for compiling your code as it will have access to the pillows libraries imediately. Pillow doesnt work with my personla compiler and I assume it's because the ibraries arent downloaded somewhere that the compiler can access. 

<b/>Atom<b><br/><br>
Is a beautiful text editor that is amazingly customizable. Before you write your code in the text editor, just name the file with a ".py" extension and save it.
